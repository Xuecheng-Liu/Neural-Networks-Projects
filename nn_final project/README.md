CNN achieves human-level accuracy in music genre classification  

We used a simple convolutional neural network to perform music genre classification to try and achieve 70% accuracy, which is comparable to the human accuracy after listening the a three second music clip. We use the GTZAN dataset (http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets/) and converted them into mel-spectrogram (64 mel-filters), the converted data is in the audio_sr_label.npz file. Download the already converted data here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3I2KG9W0zM2YmFWbk1oMFhkU1k/view. Make sure this is in the same folder as main when running the code.   

We propose two variants to this paper that we think might improve the accuracy.  

1. 

2.
